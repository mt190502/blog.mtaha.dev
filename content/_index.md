# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm 21-year-old junior software engineer using languages like Bash, C, Go, Python and Rust. I am particularly skilled in the use of these languages for developing simple Linux terminal commands. 

In this blog you can find my articles on various topics such as Linux, programming and technology.
